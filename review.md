## Interest of content
    - has choses four key areas of interest
    - each has at least some content
    - only one small section per page, with the communications being a single sentence. to be fair, this isn't really an issue as this doesn't test their html/css skills at all

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation
    - each page as has a consistent header and title design
    - each page has an author section (though only the one on the access page is entered)
    - clear grey text boxes for information display

## Quality of written presentation
    - not a fan of the yellow and purple, but that's just be hating

## Validity of HTML
    - all looks fine

## Evidence of collaboration including

# Author info not written by author
    - most author info is blank
    - I think the page where it is filled in was done by someone other than the author

# Balanced contributions from members
    - alex looks to have made 41 commits, many more than anyone else, but that doesn't neccessarily mean they did more.
    - it says noah did 203k lines, but I'm guessing that is mostly the json files
