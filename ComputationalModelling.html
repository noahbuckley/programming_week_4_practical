        Computational Modelling
    </h3>
    <p>
        Computational modeliing is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematical models.
        Letting researchers better analyze and predict the behavior of systems that are difficult to study through traditional means.
        <br> Such as:

    <ul>
        <li>Climate modeling</li>
        <li>Biological systems</li>
        <li>Financial markets</li>
    </ul>
