  <h3>
    Data Storage
  </h3>
  <p>
    Information can be stored electronically as data (represented as 1s and 0s) and then be retrieved at a later date. This comes in handy for when a lot of information is being collected and would not be realistic to write down on paper. <br>
    One well known example is storing the details of every registered person in a country.
