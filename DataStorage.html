<h3>
Data Storage
</h3>
<p>
Information can be stored electronically as data (represented as 1s and 0s) and then be retrieved at a later date. This comes in handy for when a lot of information is being collected and would not be realistic to write down on paper.
</p>
<p>
One well known example is storing the details of every registered person in a country.
